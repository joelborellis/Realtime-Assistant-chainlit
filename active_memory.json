  "structured_outputs_info": "Check out OpenAI's official documentation on structured outputs, which introduces response formats compatible with vision inputs. Azure OpenAI Service provides an article on using structured outputs where a model follows a JSON Schema definition provided in the API call. It's recommended for function calling, extracting structured data, and more. OpenAI Cookbook offers an introduction to structured outputs and discusses how the model might refuse to fulfill requests for safety reasons.",
  "OpenAI_Swarm_Info": "OpenAI's Swarm is an experimental framework designed to support multi-agent systems. It focuses on making agent coordination and execution lightweight, controllable, and testable. It utilizes two main abstractions: Agents and handoffs. Agents encompass instructions and tools, and can hand off conversations to other agents. Swarm is still in the experimental stage and may change in the future.",

  "challenge": "The Challenger A new model for high performance_Part_0 - Challenger Narration - The Challenger A new model for high performance.txt - Chapter 2. The Challenger A new model for high performance. The need to understand what your star performing groups are doing to set themselves apart from their core performing colleagues has never been more urgent. The world of sales is changing. The pre recession recipe for sales success wont get the job done in a post recession economy. That said, the economy itself serves only as a backdrop to this story. The real story revolves around the dramatic change in customer buying behaviors across the last five years that we reviewed in the previous chapter, all in response to suppliers efforts to sell larger, more complex, more disruptive. And more expensive solutions. Still, if nothing else, the global economic collapse served to throw the widening gap between core and star reps into stark contrast. Even in the depths of the downturn, when most reps were far behind quota, some reps quite inexplicably still managed not just to hit their goals, but to exceed them. What were they doing differently? Generally, the tendency in sales is to simply chalk up the difference in natural talent and assume that stars are just born with it. Its not as if you can just take their skill, bottle it, and sprinkle it over your core performers to close the gap, right? Well, what if you could? What if you could track down the replicable part of what truly sets star performers apart, capture that magic, and export it to the rest of your sales organization? Imagine a world where all of your reps, or at least many more of them, perform like stars. What would that be worth to you? What would it mean for the overall performance of your company?"
