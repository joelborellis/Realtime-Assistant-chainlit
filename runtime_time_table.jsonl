Check out OpenAI's official documentation on structured outputs, which introduces response formats compatible with vision inputs. You can find more details at [OpenAI's website](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/).\n\n2. Azure OpenAI Service provides an article on using structured outputs where a model follows a JSON Schema definition provided in the API call. It's recommended for function calling, extracting structured data, and more. You can read it [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/structured-outputs).\n\n3. OpenAI Cookbook offers an introduction to structured outputs and discusses how the model might refuse to fulfill requests for safety reasons. This information is available at [OpenAI Cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/structured_outputs_intro)."}

OpenAI Swarm, launched in 2024, is an experimental framework that simplifies the orchestration of multi-agent systems. It provides scalable and user-friendly mechanisms for managing interactions in complex workflows. More details can be found [here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/12/managing-multi-agent-systems-with-openai-swarm/).\n\n2. OpenAI's Swarm is an open-source Python framework for building, orchestrating, and deploying multi-agent systems. Its approach to control flow uses straightforward function calls to shift control between agents. Learn more at [Arize's blog](https://arize.com/blog/swarm-openai-experimental-approach-to-multi-agent-systems/).\n\n3. OpenAI's Swarm promotes collaboration between agents, like an Assistant Agent handing off conversation to a specialized Agent, such as a Weather Agent. This approach enables more autonomous handling of user requests. Find out more [here](https://lablab.ai/t/openais-swarm-a-deep-dive-into-multi-agent-orchestration-for-everyone)."}
